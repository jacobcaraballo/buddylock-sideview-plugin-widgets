#What are Side View Plugins?

BuddyLock has a powerful feature called "Side Views". Side views are views that can be easily swiped in from the left or the right of the screen. Stock sideviews are Contacts, Playlists, and Widgets. This repository contains all the code I used for the widgets sideview plugin.

Side View plugins are simply a bundle that, when installed onto the device, it is loaded into buddylock and can be selected by the user for use.

What makes these plugins powerful are their ability to interact with the tweak itself. For examples on how to create and implement BuddyLock SideView Plugins, please read the comments in the code provided.
